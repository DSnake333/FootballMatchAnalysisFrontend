# Football Match Analysis Frontend

This is the frontend of the Football Match Analysis application, built using Vue.js. The app allows users to input a match URL from [FBref](https://fbref.com/), fetch the relevant player and team statistics, and visualize the data using Plotly.

## Features
- ✅ Input an FBref match URL on the homepage.
- ✅ Validate the URL to ensure it corresponds to a valid match page.
- ✅ Fetch player and team statistics from the match.
- ✅ Generate interactive visualizations using Plotly.
- ✅ Display analytical insights on the frontend for further analysis.

## 🚀 Getting Started
